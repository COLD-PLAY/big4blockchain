- 这个只到了`500w`，这是个对`bytecode`进行`rewrite`做`patch`以防止攻击的工具
- `To verify the correctness of the patches generated by our bytecode rewriter, we utilized the state-of-the-art integer detection tool Osiris [13] for vulnerability detection. After analyzing 50,535 unique contracts in the first 5,000,000 blocks of the Ethereum blockchain, Osiris detects at least one integer overflow vulnerability in 14,107 contracts. Using EVMPATCH, we were able to successfully patch almost all of these contracts automatically. More specifically, we could not patch 33 contracts amongst the 14107 investigated contracts because the basic block, where the detected vulnerability was located is too small for the trampoline code.`
- 即为了验证他们这个`Patch`工具的有效性，他们拿了前`500w`区块的`50,535`个`unique`合约，并且用了`Osiris`分析了这些合约，发现有`14,107`个合约有整数溢出，然后用他们自己的工具进行了`Patch`，只有`33`个合约不能`Patch`

- 这个到了`2019-1-7`，不到`800w`，这篇文章对以太坊上针对`Dapp`的攻击进行了检测，用已知的漏洞以及攻击交易、`EOA`等进行分析、模型训练，然后用来检测未被报道的攻击
- `Altogether, we gathered 58,555 exploit transactions from 2016/01/29 to 2019/01/07, which involve in 56 victim
Dapps (29 have never been reported before). To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest dataset for on-chain victim
Dapp attack incidents that have ever been reported. We will release it on publishing this paper.`
- 就是只收集了`16/01/29`到`19/01/07`的这些攻击、交易、`EOA`、合约啥的，`7025000`左右，不到`800w`

- 这个实验验证部分只用了`Etherscan`上面的`Top200`的`ERC20`，我看不懂他写的是什么，但应该是检测合约的漏洞的
- `To perform this large scale evaluation, we collected from EtherScan the 200 (unique) most widely-used ERC20 contracts whose source is available. Among these 200 contracts, 49 of them cannot be analyzed by KEVM-VER, which leaves us with a total of 151 contracts to evaluate on.`
- 就是为了验证这个工具的厉害做了大规模的实验，但其实只选择了`Etherscan`上面的`Top200`的`ERC20`，显然要远远小于我们实验的`Token`规模
